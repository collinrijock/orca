// The abrupt main-process crash + its Windows event-log forensics.
//
// GitHub #7742: when Orca's main/renderer process died on Windows, the terminal
// daemon (which hosts the ConPTYs) died with it, severing the console pipe, and
// PowerShell hard-crashed with a 0xE9 "No process is on the other end of the
// pipe" FailFast. The fix relocates the daemon into a standalone, detached
// orca-terminal-daemon.exe that SURVIVES main death (src/main/daemon/
// daemon-host-relocation.ts). This module reproduces the crash and scans for the
// pwsh FailFast that must no longer occur.

 * daemon alive for the wrong reason and make the survival assertion pass
 * vacuously. Kills exactly `pid` (the real Electron main of the instance the
 * harness launched, resolved via app.evaluate -> process.pid), never a scanned
 * or image-named process, so a live user Orca on the same box is never touched.

/**
 * Scan the Windows Application event log for pwsh/powershell FailFast crashes in
 * the crash window (from `sinceMs`). The #7742 signature is a 0xE9 exit / "No
 * process is on the other end of the pipe" / FailFast (0xc0000409 stack-overrun),
 * reported as an Application Error (#1000), Windows Error Reporting (#1001), or
 * .NET Runtime (#1026) event for pwsh.exe. Matching by provider+id (not Message
 * text alone) matters because Message can be null when the provider's resource
 * DLL does not render — a null-Message crash from those reporters is still counted
 * unless its text positively rules out pwsh, so we never miss a real FailFast.
 *
 * The scan is MACHINE-WIDE (Get-WinEvent has no per-process filter): on an
 * isolated CI runner nothing else crashes in the ~10s window, so it can only ever
 * false-FAIL (an unrelated crash), never false-PASS. Zero events is the decisive
 * proof the ConPTY pipe was NOT severed. Returns
 * { events: [{ id, provider, timeCreated, message }] }.
